Joycribe Application Overview
This document provides instructions for setting up and running the Joycribe application.

Joycribe is a web application built with React. It uses the Google Gemini API to upload, transcribe, and analyze audio and video calls, with results displayed in a comprehensive dashboard. This version of the application runs entirely in the browser and does not require a separate backend server. All processing, including audio/video transcription and analysis, is performed client-side using the Gemini API.
